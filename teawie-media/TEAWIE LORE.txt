Teawie "bullets" typically lodge into parts of a body and proceed to infect the victim. If a Teawie ends up lodged into the brain, Teawie will be inside the mind of the user, reigning pure terror until the victim passes on. Teawie will pilot the victim like a meat suit until decomposition fully occurs, and then find a new host.
